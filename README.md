# What's Left

World of Warcraft Addon

Hide collected appearances, mounts, pets, toys, and sets directly from vendors — showing you what's left to collect.

## Why What's Left?

This addon was made because I didn't want to juggle multiple addons just to see how much bronze I still needed or what I hadn't collected yet. This addon combines everything I wanted, a simple breakdown, unlearned total, and clean filtering, all in one lightweight package.

## Features

- Hide Categories: Whether it be mounts, toys, pets, or appearances, toggle between which of these you want or don't want to see on your screen. (Hiding currently unavailable items also updates your necessary Bronze cost in real time.)
- Unlearned Total: Quickly calculate how much more Bronze you'll need to complete everything the vendor has to offer.
- Breakdown: See a clear comparison of learned vs. unlearned items and their total Bronze cost, helping you track progress and spending at a glance. (Click the Bronze icon within "Unlearned Total" for the breakdown container to appear.)
- Super Light Weight: Built for speed, minimal code, maximum clarity.
- Legion Remix Ready: Designed around Legion Remix vendors, simple plug-and-play setup that works with the default UI, ElvUI, and most custom reskins.
